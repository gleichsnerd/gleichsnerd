                <p>
                    Hi there! My name is Adam Gleichsner, and I'm a frontend engineer and collector of hobbies based out of Columbus, Ohio, USA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By day, I'm the tech lead for frontend development at Paxata, a company that specializes in building the future of data preparation by putting the power in the hands of the business analysts. In non-PR lingo? I write a vast amount of code in a well-weathered codebase while helping to educate/mentor my teammates and drive our tech stack towards the future, bit by bit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, my technical interests lie all across UI/UX/Frontend-land along with occasional oddball curiosities like WebGL/ThreeJS and Raspberry Pi projects. I've previously worked as a full-stack engineer so I try to stay sharp by building end-to-end eclectic and (hopefully) wholesome hobby projects that I can't wait to share.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides being a software engineer and the holder of the coveted family alias, <code>gleichsnerd</code>, I'm also an avid camper, dabbling film photographer, occasional sculptor, and general purveyor of internet tomfoolery. I'm also prone to the occasional Netflix binge, love decompressing to video games, and have a small family of pets that my fiancÃ©e and I spoil without abandon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right now this space is pretty sparse and is notably lacking a blog and mailing list, so if you'd like to follow my antics in the meantime, feel free to hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/gleichsnerd">twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gleichsnerd/">instagram</a>, or through my <a href="#contact">contact page</a> if you're really going for that personal touch.

                    Operating in the data preparation space, Paxata allows business users to upload, investigate, and scrub incredibly large amounts of data in real time, giving them instant feedback as they shape, normalize, and filter to their hearts' content. While working here, I've collaborated with designers and teammates to undertake some colossal projects, from page redesigns to some of the largest features ever added to our product offering.
