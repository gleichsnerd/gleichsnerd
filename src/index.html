                        My name is Adam Gleichsner <sup><a href="https://enbyeducation.carrd.co/">(they/them)</a></sup>, but you can also find me across the internet as <samp>gleichsnerd</samp>.
                        I'm a software engineer based out of Columbus, OH, currently working at DataRobot.<sup>(<a href="#legal">legal disclaimer</a>)</sup>

                    <p>
                        My professional work resides more on the frontend, where I lead frontend feature teams from the technical side of things by designing architecture, helping my fellow team members through continued learning and mentoring (and they teach me cool stuff in the process), and coding alongside them while providing feedback throughout the entire product life cycle.
                        Although I personally feel like I shine the brightest when working on the frontend, I'm also comfortable diving into the nitty gritty depths of the server and have experience working throughout the tech stack.
                        My favorite projects are ones that push the boundaries of what web apps can do, have intricate performance concerns, or ultimately creates something that enables others to make <b>really cool stuff</b> that brings joy.

                    <p>
                        Outside of work, I try to find a nice balance between technical and non-technical hobbies.
                        Lately, I've been entranced with <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> and <a href="https://www.blender.org/">3D modeling in Blender</a>, which has also led me to pick back up real-life sculpting (I use <a href="https://www.monstermakers.com/monster-clay/">Monster Clay</a> if you're into that sort of thing).
