          My name is Adam Gleichsner
          <sup>(<a href="https://enbyeducation.carrd.co/">they/them</a>)</sup>,
          but you can also find me across the internet as
          <samp>gleichsnerd</samp>. I'm a software engineer based out of
          Columbus, OH, currently working at DataRobot<sup
            >(<a href="#legal">legal disclaimer</a>)</sup
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          My professional work resides mostly on the frontend, where I've helped
          build and maintain webapps written in React, AngularJS, and Ember.js.
          Most days, my days consist of leading frontend feature teams, whether
          that's by designing architecture, guiding my fellow teammates through
          continued group learning and mentoring, or coding alongside them.
          Although I personally feel like I shine the brightest when working in
          the browser, I'm also comfortable diving into the nitty gritty depths
          of the server and have experience working throughout the tech stack.
          My favorite projects are ones that push the boundaries of what webapps
          can do, have intricate performance concerns, or ultimately creates
          something that enables others to make <b>really cool stuff</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I try to find a nice balance between technical and
          non-technical hobbies. Lately, I've been entranced with
          <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> and
          <a href="https://www.blender.org/">3D modeling in Blender</a>, which
          has also led me to pick back up real-world physical sculpting (I use
          <a href="https://www.monstermakers.com/monster-clay/">Monster Clay</a>
          if you're into that sort of thing).

              I thankfully managed to enlist help from a coworker when building out this course (I was a bit too excited when I volunteered and overestimated the scale 😅). My main contributions were building out the backend game server along with drafting the lesson plan and making a handful of sample bots for the students to play against.

It boasts a huge array of features, including collaborative projects to handle your data transformations, connector support for dozens of third-party data stores, and an intelligent automation system that allows you to run entire dependency graphs that can span across the entire platform, from import to export and everything in between!

              After acquiring Paxata at the end of 2019, DataRobot is poised to be the best platform in the market for transforming your data into value. From data ingest to data preparation, feature engineering to building and deploying models, their AI/ML product offering is not only one of the most robust, but also one of the easiest to use (while still allowing you to take the reins whenever you're comfortable).
