                    <p>
                        My name is Adam Gleichsner <sup>(<a href="https://enbyeducation.carrd.co/">they/them</a>)</sup>, but you can also find me across the internet as <samp>gleichsnerd</samp>.
                        I'm a software engineer based out of Columbus, OH, currently working at DataRobot<sup>(<a href="#legal">legal disclaimer</a>)</sup>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My professional work resides mostly on the frontend, where I've helped build and maintain webapps written in React, AngularJS, and Ember.js. Most days, my days consist of leading frontend feature teams, whether that's by designing architecture, guiding my fellow teammates through continued group learning and mentoring, or coding alongside them.
                        Although I personally feel like I shine the brightest when working in the browser, I'm also comfortable diving into the nitty gritty depths of the server and have experience working throughout the tech stack.
                        My favorite projects are ones that push the boundaries of what webapps can do, have intricate performance concerns, or ultimately creates something that enables others to make <b>really cool stuff</b>.

                    <p>
                        Outside of work, I try to find a nice balance between technical and non-technical hobbies.
                        Lately, I've been entranced with <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> and <a href="https://www.blender.org/">3D modeling in Blender</a>, which has also led me to pick back up real-world physical sculpting (I use <a href="https://www.monstermakers.com/monster-clay/">Monster Clay</a> if you're into that sort of thing).
